# ETCH-A-SKETCH
Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Hover your cursor over a square to draw something onto the pad.
Initially rainbow colors will be displayed in each box.
You can click on the 'TOGGLE BLACK' button to have black display on hover.
You can click on the 'ERASER' button to have white display in each box.
The 'RESET' button allows you to change the size of the drawing pad.

By doing this project I learned about:
- Mouseover Events
- Toggling classes
- Removing all children from a parent node
- CSS Grids
- How to create random rgb colors
- How to decrease the intensity of a color
- How to use regex to extract all numbers from a string
